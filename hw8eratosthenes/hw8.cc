	Write an assembler subroutine to calculate eratosthenes' sieve.
	You are counting the number of primes from 2 to n.
	First set all bits to 1 (you can do this 32 bits at a time by setting
	each word to 0xFFFFFFFF)
	Then for each prime (for example 2) clear all multiples of that number.
	pseudocode:

	set all numbers to prime
	for i = 4 to n step 2
	  isPrime[i] = false   (4, 6, 8, ... not prime)

	for i = 3 to n step 2
	  if isPrime(i)
      for j = i*i to n step 2*i
        isPrime[j] = false
